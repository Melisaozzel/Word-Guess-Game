# Word Guess Game 
It is my first year final project

This program is a word guessing game. We randomly select a five-letter word from a dictionary of words. 
Each turn the player will guess a word. If the guess is correct, the computer program ends. If the guess is wrong, the program shows how many letters are correctly matched, whether the letters are correctly placed. With this information, the user makes a guess again. Each guess gets a little closer to the result.
